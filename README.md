# Binary Grid Puzzle Solver 

## Description
The bingrid project is designed to solve binary grid puzzles. These puzzles consist of a grid filled with 1's, 0's, and unknowns (represented as '.'). The solver works by employing certain predefined rules to deduce the value of unknown spots in the grid until a solution is found or it is determined that the puzzle cannot be solved.


## Features
・　Parses input strings representing binary puzzles.
・　Utilizes multiple puzzle-solving rules, such as Pair and Oxo, to deduce unknown values.
・　Outputs the solution in a human-readable format or indicates if no solution can be found.
・　Integrates Address and Undefined Sanitizers for safer development.
